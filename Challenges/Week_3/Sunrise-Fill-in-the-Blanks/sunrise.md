### Write a Fill in the Blank program (similar to the one in the Print Input Lesson). Your program should request three strings from the user:

1. a color
2. an adjective
3. a goal you would like to achieve 


The story should then fill in the template:

At dawn the sky turned [color], and the air felt [adjective]. I decided today I will finally [goal].


Here is an example run of the program:

```python
A color: blue
An adjective: smelly
A goal you would like to achieve: eat fewer bugs
At dawn the sky turned blue, and the air felt smelly. I decided today I will finally eat fewer bugs.
